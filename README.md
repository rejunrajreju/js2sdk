## JS2SDK

JS2SDK is an SDK generator for javascript based client scripts. It is an Open source tool which will help you to compose the projects in an organised way, no matter what is your server. This tool will help the developers, mainly Hybrid Mobile App developers to concentrate more on business logic leaving other technical functional implementation like login, offline data management, synchronisation in an effective way. Dont get confused, Js2sdk is not a framework. It is an SDK generator build for your project and can be used with any client side framework like angular js, jquery or with a plain javascript.
